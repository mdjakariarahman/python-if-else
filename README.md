# 🐍 Python Conditionals Project

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script demonstrating different types of conditional statements:

- `if` and nested `if-else`
- Ternary operator (Python's shorthand `if-else`)
- Full `if-elif-else` chain

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Write a script that performs the following:

1. Checks if a number `a` is greater than 70.
    - If yes, print `"above 70"`
    - If also greater than 80, print `"also above 80"`, else print `"not above 80"`

2. Uses a ternary operator to print:
    - `"a is greater than b"` if it is
    - Otherwise, `"nothing"`

3. Implements a full comparison logic to print:
    - `"a is greater than b"`
    - `"a is less than b"`
    - `"a is equal to b"`

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Conditional logic
- Nested conditions
- Ternary operator
- Clean code formatting

---

## 💻 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Run the script with:

```bash
python main.py

## ✅ Sample Output

above 70
not above 80
nothing
a is less than b
